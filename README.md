My first data analysis book. 

- [ ] 1. Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`.

- [ ] 2. Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `index.html` in a browser).

- [ ] 3. If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub. 

- [ ] 4. Use this code to go the book  usethis::browse_github()
(You will need to repeat steps 1 and 3 every time you wish to update the book online.)
